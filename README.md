Welcome to my personal webpage. I am a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.uma.es/departamentos/info/4608/departamento-lenguajes-y-ciencias-de-la-computacion/) at the [University of Malaga](https://www.uma.es/). My research interests are in the area of machine learning and bioinformatics. I am currently working on the development of algorithms and workflows for the detection of model and concept drift of machine and deep learning models.

In this website you will find information about my research, publications, and projects. You can also find some personal information and links to my social media profiles.
