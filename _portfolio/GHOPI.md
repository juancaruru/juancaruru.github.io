This is my own bachelor's thesis. The project is a web server that allows an Open Project User to connect to one or several GitHub organizations in order to follow correctly the good practices of project management. THe server uses the web hooks technology of GitHub and Open Project to keep the information updated. The server also provides a web interface to allow the user to configure the server and to see real-time information about the status of it. It also provides a REST API to allow the user to interact with the server. This application was entirely made in **GO**.
