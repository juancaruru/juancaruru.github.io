This was a small project for a University Project of Didactics of the Mathematics for a Degree in Primary Education. The idea was to create a bingo game to help children learn some math's concepts.

The game is simple, the user has to select a bingo card and then the game will start. The game will show a math's question and the user has to select the correct answer from the bingo card. The game will continue until the user completes a line or the whole card.

This project was entirely made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
