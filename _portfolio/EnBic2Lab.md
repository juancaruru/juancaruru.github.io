Within my first months in Khaos Research Group I have participated in the development of EnBic2Lab portal. This is a web application based on semantics and it aims to provide tools for biologists and scientist to manage a wide variety of information, such us soil, flora or fauna data. The main application of this project was an instance of TITAN an online workflow management system. This tool provides the user with a web interface to create and launch workflows that allows them to process and analysis every kind of information. I have been working on the development of components for several workflows, I have created some interfaces of the portal and me with a small group of colleages have made the **Vulture Flight Application** found in the fauna section of the portal. This application is a web interface that allows the user to see the flight of a vulture from the data collected by a GPS device. This application was made using **Python**, **Leaflet** and **D3.js**.
